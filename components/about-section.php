          I am a self-taught web developer who began my coding journey in 2016. With three years of professional
          experience, I have
          successfully completed over thirty projects, ranging from personal projects to impactful contributions for
          businesses.

          <br>
          <br>

          Throughout my career, I have demonstrated an exceptional ability to adapt and innovate, always pushing the
          boundaries of frontend development with a strong focus on React JS. My dedication and hands-on approach have
          not only sharpened my technical expertise but also earned me a reputation as a reliable and creative problem
          solver.

          <br>
          <br>

          In the ever-evolving world of web development, my journey exemplifies resilience, passion, and a relentless
          drive to deliver excellence.
